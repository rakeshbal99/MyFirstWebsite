      <h2 class="align-text">I feel in life achievement is endless. You can go on achieveing feats if you are hardworking. However, I feel getting a rank of 265 in JEE Advanced was my greatest achievement till date. Also getting a rank of 187 in JEE Mains was pretty special to me. My board(+2 CHSE,Odisha) Percentage is 89%. I secured 96% in my 10th ICSE board examination with 100/100 in Computer Science. That's it for now but I hope I am able to fill this part with more stuff. </h2>

I am especially interested in competitive coding,image processing and web development.Hope I get to learn and master these things in the near future.I like mathematics and statistics a lot as they build the basic foundation of almost anything existing in this world. They also offer a lot of challenging things to understand which gives a boost to logical reasoning.</h2>

      <h2 class="align-text">I love listening to music and am a Anime Lover. I almost wear my headphones for hours and listen to almost all genres of music available all the day. I also try to sing those songs and make a note of the kind of the music used in the song. I have also recorded a few songs using the Karaoke app. I also love watching Anime Series. My favorite is YU-Gi-Oh which I have almost twice in my lifespan. Watching Anime keeps me free frm stress. </h2>

      <h2 class="align-text">After entering KGP I was wondering about the opportunities that KGP would provide. However, I was stunned by the plethora of opportunities available here. I am a NCC(National Cadet Corps) Cadet,the very organisation responsible for the grooming of youth to work for one's country and provide opportunities for the same. I am also SOftware Team Member of AUV(Autonomous UnderWater Vehicle) the research group aiming to build autonomous bots for carrying underwater tasks.</h2>
